# YouTube-Playlist-Delete-Video
YouTube removed the Trash icon from playlists and replaced with a dropdown. The new behaviour requires the user to press twice which is a hassle when you have many videos to remove. This Stylus style moves the dropdown that will appear slightly upwards, allowing you to double click to remove a video from a playlist.
